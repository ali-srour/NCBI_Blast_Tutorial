 Introduction into using NCBI BLAST web interface

### Introduction
The  Basic  Local  Alignment  Search  Tool  (BLAST)  is  a  program  that  can  detect sequence similarity  between  a Query sequence  and  sequences  within  a  database.    The  ability  to  detect sequence homology allows us to ID unknown sequences (species, genes, protein..),  identify putative genes in a novel sequence.  It also allows us to determine if a specie, a gene or a protein is related to other known species, genes or proteins.

### NCBI BLAST web interface
Before we begin analyzing any unknown sequence, we should first familiarize ourselves with the NCBI  BLAST  web  interface.  
Open  a  new  web  browser window  and  navigate  to  the  BLAST main page at http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi.  In this tutorial, we will only use a few of the tools  available. Click on the “Help” button to learn more about the BLAST web interface at NCBI.
